# Full Development Workflow

## 1. Planning
- Analyze the task in detail and possible implementation approaches
- Highlight architectural forks, their features, pros and cons
- Justify architectural choices
- Describe detailed implementation plan point by point
- Provide brief illustrative code examples for key implementation details
- Draw file structure
- Finish with: "Plan ready. Confirm for implementation or specify corrections."

## 2. Plan Confirmation
- Wait for explicit user confirmation ("OK", "approved", "implement")
- For corrections — update plan and request re-confirmation
- Do not proceed to implementation without confirmation

## 3. Code Implementation
- Follow user requirements to the last letter
- Fully implement all required functionality
- Leave no TODOs, placeholders, or missing fragments
- Respect TypeScript/ESLint configuration when writing code
- Implement error handling and edge cases for user interaction
- Implement logging of key application points

## 4. Test Coverage
- Create unit tests for new functions/components (Jest)
- Cover all public methods and key scenarios with tests
- Add integration tests for API endpoints
- Tests must pass: npm test

## 5. Testing
- Verify project build works in production and development modes
- Run TypeScript check: npx tsc --noEmit
- Run ESLint check: npx eslint src/ --fix
- Test all functionality and user scenarios
- Check console for warnings and errors
- All checks must pass without errors or warnings

## 6. Documentation
- Use JSDoc for documentation
  - Use complete sentences with proper punctuation and syntax
  - Make descriptions clear and concise
- Document:
  - Overall application architecture and key details
  - All public functions, classes, methods, and interfaces
  - Add examples when necessary

## 7. GitHub Commit
- Create meaningful commit message following Conventional Commits:
  - feat: new functionality
  - fix: bug fixes
  - docs: documentation
  - chore: minor changes
- List completed work in commit description
- Execute: git add . && git commit -m "feat: ..."

## 8. Project Documentation Update
- Update .cursor/rules/sandbox-project/01-project-overview.mdc
- Update README.md with new usage instructions
- Mark task status as completed in .cursor/rules/sandbox-tasks/
- Proceed to next task only after completing all stages
